GranadaLayout
=============

This is an attempt to implement a layout system for iOS that works similar to Android.
The primary goals are to implement layout views like ``LinearLayout`` and ``RelativeLayout``.

The current status is: just played around a few hours, initial implementation of ``LinearLayout``.
Collaborations and suggestions are very welcome.

TODO:
-----
- Implement gravity on LinearLayout
- Add size calculation for all UIKit base views
- Add size calculation for the layouts, so that they can be embedded in other views
- Implement the RelativeLayout
- Test, test, test!
