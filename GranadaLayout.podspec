                   GranadaLayout tries to emulate the Android Layout system and bring as much as possible from its functionality to the iOS world.
		   It includes a relative layout to position and size views relative to each other and a linear layout to stack views.
 		   A layout inflater is also provided, so that layouts can be defined in simple JSON files.
